# [Human Activity Recognition](../c.%20Jupyter%20Notebooks/Human%20Activity%20Recognition.ipynb)


## Project Overview
Human activity recognition (HAR) is essential for applications in health monitoring, sports analytics, and smart 
environments. This project focuses on clustering human activities based on sensor data collected from a smartphone's 
accelerometer and gyroscope. By analysing movement patterns, we can group similar activities without predefined labels, 
uncovering hidden structures in the data.

## Data Dictionary
Omitted due to the large number of features.

## Objective
Apply classification & clustering techniques to identify distinct activity patterns based on motion sensor data,
aiding in automatic activity recognition and behavioural analysis.
