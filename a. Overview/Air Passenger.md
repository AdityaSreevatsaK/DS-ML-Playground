# [Air Passenger Forecasting](../c.%20Jupyter%20Notebooks/Air%20Passenger.ipynb)


## Project Overview
Air traffic refers to the movement of passengers by airlines, which can be influenced by various factors such as 
seasonality, economic conditions, and global events. Understanding passenger trends is crucial for airlines and 
airports to optimise capacity, manage resources, and enhance customer satisfaction. This project aims to build a 
predictive model for airline passenger numbers using historical data from the airPassengers dataset. By forecasting 
future passenger volumes, the airline industry can better plan operations, adjust staffing, and implement targeted 
marketing strategies to improve service and efficiency.

## Dataset Dictionary
- Dates representing each month from 1949 to 1960.
- Pax (or "Passengers") representing the number of airline passengers recorded in that month.

## Objective
The primary goal is to forecast the number of airline passengers for upcoming months based on historical passenger data. 
This will be achieved by analysing trends, seasonality, and potential influencing factors such as holidays or economic 
indicators. Accurate predictions will enable airlines to optimise flight schedules, manage staffing levels, and enhance
operational efficiency.
