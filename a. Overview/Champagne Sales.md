# [Champagne Sales Forecasting](../c.%20Jupyter%20Notebooks/Champagne%20Sales.ipynb)


## Project Overview
The Champagne dataset typically contains monthly sales data for champagne, which can be influenced by factors such as 
seasonality, marketing efforts, and economic conditions. Understanding sales trends is essential for producers and 
retailers to optimise inventory, plan marketing campaigns, and enhance customer satisfaction. This project aims to 
analyse historical sales data to identify patterns and forecast future champagne sales. By accurately predicting sales 
volumes, stakeholders can make informed decisions regarding production, distribution, and marketing strategies.

## Data Dictionary
- Months: Represents the time period of sales data, usually recorded on a monthly basis. Each entry corresponds to a 
- specific month and year.
- Sales: Indicates the total number of champagne bottles sold during the corresponding month. This numerical value 
- reflects the demand and market performance of champagne.

## Objective
The primary goal is to forecast future champagne sales based on historical monthly sales data. This will be achieved by 
analysing trends, seasonality, and any influencing factors. Accurate sales predictions will enable producers and 
retailers to better manage inventory, optimise production schedules, and develop targeted marketing strategies to 
enhance sales performance.
