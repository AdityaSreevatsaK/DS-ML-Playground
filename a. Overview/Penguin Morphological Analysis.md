# [Penguin Morphological Analysis](../c.%20Jupyter%20Notebooks/Penguin%20Morphological%20Analysis.ipynb)

## Project Overview
Penguins exhibit diverse morphological traits that can be used to group them into meaningful clusters. By analysing key 
physical attributes such as culmen length, culmen depth, flipper length, and body mass, we can apply clustering 
techniques to identify distinct groups within the penguin population. This analysis helps in understanding species 
similarities, habitat-based adaptations, and evolutionary traits.

## Data Dictionary
- culmen_length_mm: Length of the upper part of the beak (culmen) in millimetres
- culmen_depth_mm: Depth of the culmen in millimetres
- flipper_length_mm: Length of the penguinâ€™s flippers in millimetres
- body_mass_g: Weight of the penguin in grams

## Objective
Apply clustering techniques to group penguins based on their morphological features, helping in species differentiation, 
ecological analysis, and evolutionary studies.
