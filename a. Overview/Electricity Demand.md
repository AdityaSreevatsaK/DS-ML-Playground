# [Electricity Demand](../c.%20Jupyter%20Notebooks/Electricity%20Demand.ipynb)


## Project Overview
Electricity demand fluctuates based on factors such as time of day, weather conditions, and economic activities. 
Accurate forecasting is crucial for energy providers to optimise grid operations, reduce costs, and ensure a stable 
power supply. This project focuses on analysing historical electricity consumption data to predict future demand, 
enabling better resource planning and load management.

## Data Dictionary
- Date: Timestamp representing the date and time of recorded electricity demand.
- Demand: The total electricity consumption measured in megawatts (MW) or kilowatt-hours (kWh).

## Objective
Develop a time series forecasting model to predict electricity demand, assisting in efficient energy distribution, peak 
load management, and operational planning.
