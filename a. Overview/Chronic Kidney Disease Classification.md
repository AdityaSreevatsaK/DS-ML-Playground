# [Chronic Kidney Disease Classification](../c.%20Jupyter%20Notebooks/Chronic%20Kidney%20Disease%20Classification.ipynb)


## Project Overview
Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) is a serious health condition that requires early detection for effective management. 
Using patient demographics, laboratory test results, and medical history, the goal is to build a machine learning model 
to classify whether a person has CKD.

## Data Dictionary
- id: Unique patient identifier
- age: Age of the patient in years
- bp: Blood pressure (mmHg)
- sg: Specific gravity of urine
- al: Albumin levels in urine
- su: Sugar levels in urine
- rbc: Red blood cell count (Normal/Abnormal)
- pc: Pus cell count (Normal/Abnormal)
- pcc: Presence of pus cell clumps (Present/Not present)
- ba: Presence of bacteria (Present/Not present)
- bgr: Blood glucose random test result (mg/dL)
- bu: Blood urea levels (mg/dL)
- sc: Serum creatinine levels (mg/dL)
- sod: Sodium levels (mEq/L)
- pot: Potassium levels (mEq/L)
- hemo: Hemoglobin levels (g/dL)
- pcv: Packed cell volume
- wc: White blood cell count
- rc: Red blood cell count
- htn: Hypertension status (Yes/No)
- dm: Diabetes mellitus status (Yes/No)
- cad: Coronary artery disease status (Yes/No)
- appet: Appetite status (Good/Poor)
- pe: Presence of pedal edema (Yes/No)
- ane: Anemia status (Yes/No)
- classification: Target variable indicating CKD status (CKD/Not CKD)

## Objective
Develop a machine learning model to classify whether a patient has Chronic Kidney Disease, aiding in early diagnosis 
and treatment planning.
