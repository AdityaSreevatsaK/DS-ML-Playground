# [Churn Prediction](../c.%20Jupyter%20Notebooks/Churn%20Prediction.ipynb)


## Project Overview
Customer retention is a key challenge for financial institutions. Understanding the factors influencing customer churn 
can help in proactive engagement. The goal is to build a machine learning model to predict whether a customer is likely 
to leave the bank.

## Data Dictionary
- RowNumber: Index of the row in the dataset
- CustomerId: Unique identifier for the customer
- Surname: Customer's surname (not useful for prediction)
- CreditScore: Customer's credit score
- Geography: Country of residence
- Gender: Gender of the customer (Male/Female)
- Age: Age of the customer in years
- Tenure: Number of years the customer has been with the bank
- Balance: Account balance of the customer
- NumOfProducts: Number of financial products used by the customer
- HasCrCard: Whether the customer has a credit card (0 = No, 1 = Yes)
- IsActiveMember: Whether the customer is an active bank member (0 = No, 1 = Yes)
- EstimatedSalary: Estimated annual salary of the customer
- Exited: Target variable indicating whether the customer left the bank (0 = No, 1 = Yes)

## Objective
Develop a machine learning model to predict customer churn, enabling banks to take proactive measures for customer 
retention.
