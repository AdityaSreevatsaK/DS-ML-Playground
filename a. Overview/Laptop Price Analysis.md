# [Laptop Price Analysis](../c.%20Jupyter%20Notebooks/Laptop%20Price%20Analysis.ipynb)


## Project Overview
This project involves analysing a dataset containing detailed laptop specifications and their prices in Euros. The aim 
is to perform data preprocessing, feature engineering, and model training to predict laptop prices accurately using 
machine learning algorithms.
