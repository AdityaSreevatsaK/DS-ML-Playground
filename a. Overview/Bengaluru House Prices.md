# [Bengaluru House Prices](../c.%20Jupyter%20Notebooks/Bengaluru%20House%20Prices.ipynb)

## Project Overview
This project focuses on predicting residential property prices in Bengaluru, one of Indiaâ€™s rapidly growing metropolitan 
areas. The dataset captures various aspects of housing properties across the city, including location, size, amenities, 
and proximity to city centers. By analyzing this data, the project aims to uncover key drivers of property prices in 
Bengaluru and build a predictive model to estimate house prices based on these factors. This model will be valuable for 
prospective buyers, sellers, and real estate stakeholders looking to make data-driven decisions in Bengaluru's 
competitive housing market.

## Project Objective
The objective is to build a machine learning model that can predict house prices using the given dataset's features. 
This will involve data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, and model building to derive 
insights and achieve reliable predictions.
