# [Retail Sales](../c.%20Jupyter%20Notebooks/Retail%20Sales.ipynb)


## Project Overview
The Retail Sales dataset typically comprises monthly or daily sales data from retail stores, reflecting consumer demand 
trends. Sales can be influenced by factors such as seasonality, promotions, holidays, and economic conditions. 
Understanding sales patterns is crucial for retailers to manage inventory, optimise pricing strategies, and enhance 
customer satisfaction. This project focuses on analysing historical retail sales data to uncover trends and forecast 
future sales. Accurate predictions will enable businesses to make data-driven decisions regarding stock management, 
staffing, and marketing campaigns.

## Data Dictionary
- Date: Represents the time period of sales data, recorded on a daily or monthly basis. Each entry corresponds to a 
specific date.
- Sales: Indicates the total revenue or quantity of products sold during the corresponding time period, reflecting 
overall demand and market performance.

## Objective
The primary goal is to forecast future retail sales based on historical sales data. This will be achieved by identifying 
trends, seasonal patterns, and external influencing factors. Accurate sales predictions will help retailers optimise 
stock levels, allocate resources effectively, and implement targeted marketing strategies to maximise revenue.
