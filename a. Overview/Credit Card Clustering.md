# [Credit Card Clustering](../c.%20Jupyter%20Notebooks/Credit%20Card%20Clustering.ipynb)


## Project Overview
Understanding customer spending behaviour is crucial for financial institutions to optimise services, personalise 
offers, and reduce credit risk. Using transaction and balance details, the goal is to apply clustering techniques to 
segment credit card customers based on their spending patterns.

## Data Dictionary
- CUST_ID: Unique identifier for the customer
- BALANCE: Customer’s account balance
- BALANCE_FREQUENCY: Frequency of balance updates
- PURCHASES: Total amount spent by the customer
- ONEOFF_PURCHASES: Total amount spent in one-time purchases
- INSTALLMENTS_PURCHASES: Total amount spent in installment-based purchases
- CASH_ADVANCE: Total cash advances taken by the customer
- PURCHASES_FREQUENCY: Frequency of purchases made by the customer
- ONEOFF_PURCHASES_FREQUENCY: Frequency of one-time purchases
- PURCHASES_INSTALLMENTS_FREQUENCY: Frequency of installment-based purchases
- CASH_ADVANCE_FREQUENCY: Frequency of cash advances taken
- CASH_ADVANCE_TRX: Number of cash advance transactions
- PURCHASES_TRX: Number of purchase transactions
- CREDIT_LIMIT: Customer’s credit limit
- PAYMENTS: Total amount of payments made by the customer
- MINIMUM_PAYMENTS: Minimum payments made by the customer
- PRC_FULL_PAYMENT: Percentage of full payments made
- TENURE: Number of months the customer has been with the bank

## Objective
Apply clustering techniques to segment customers based on their credit card usage patterns, enabling banks to 
personalise offerings, detect risky behaviour, and improve customer satisfaction.
