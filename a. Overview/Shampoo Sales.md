# [Shampoo Sales](../c.%20Jupyter%20Notebooks/Shampoo%20Sales.ipynb)


## Project Overview
The Shampoo Sales dataset consists of monthly sales data for a shampoo product, reflecting purchasing patterns over 
time. Sales fluctuations may be driven by factors such as seasonality, marketing campaigns, consumer demand, and 
external economic conditions. Understanding these trends is essential for inventory planning, pricing strategies, and 
demand forecasting. This project analyses historical shampoo sales data to uncover patterns and predict future sales. 
Accurate forecasting will enable businesses to optimise supply chain management, reduce stock outs, and improve sales 
performance.

## Data Dictionary
- Month: Represents the time period for sales data, recorded on a monthly basis. Each entry corresponds to a specific 
month.
- Sales: Indicates the total quantity of shampoo units sold during the corresponding month, reflecting overall consumer 
demand.

## Objective
The primary aim is to forecast future shampoo sales based on historical data. This involves identifying trends, 
seasonal variations, and other influencing factors. Reliable sales predictions will assist businesses in maintaining 
optimal inventory levels, planning production schedules, and executing data-driven marketing strategies.
