# [Oil Prices](../c.%20Jupyter%20Notebooks/Oil%20Prices.ipynb)


## Project Overview
This project aims to explore and analyse oil price data over time. By examining historical data, trends, and possible 
correlations with external factors (e.g., geopolitical events, economic indicators), the goal is to uncover insights 
that could inform decision-making in industries reliant on oil prices.

## Data Dictionary
- Date: The date corresponding to the oil price value
- Value: The price of oil on the given date (typically in USD/barrel)

## Overview
The main objective is to analyse the oil price trends over a specific period to identify patterns, seasonal effects, and 
volatility. The project can further involve building predictive models or conducting time series analysis to forecast 
future oil prices based on past trends.
