# [Loan Prediction](../c.%20Jupyter%20Notebooks/Loan%20Prediction.ipynb)


## Project Overview
Financial institutions aim to assess customer creditworthiness to minimise loan defaults. Using customer demographics, 
financial history, and activity, the goal is to build a machine learning model to predict whether a customer will take 
a loan.

## Data Dictionary
- CustomerId: Unique identifier for the customer
- CreditScore: Customer's credit score
- Geography: Country of residence
- Gender: Gender of the customer (Male/Female)
- Age: Age of the customer in years
- Tenure: Number of years the customer has been with the bank
- Balance: Account balance of the customer
- NumOfProducts: Number of financial products used by the customer
- HasCrCard: Whether the customer has a credit card (0 = No, 1 = Yes)
- IsActiveMember: Whether the customer is an active bank member (0 = No, 1 = Yes)
- EstimatedSalary: Estimated annual salary of the customer
- Loan: Target variable indicating whether the customer took a loan (0 = No, 1 = Yes)

## Objective
Develop a machine learning model to predict the likelihood of a customer taking a loan, helping financial institutions 
in risk assessment and targeted marketing.
