# [Graduate Admission Prediction](../c.%20Jupyter%20Notebooks/Graduate%20Admissions.ipynb)


## Project Overview
This project explores factors influencing the likelihood of graduate admissions from an Indian perspective. Using 
classification algorithms, the model provides insights into a studentâ€™s chances of admission based on various academic 
and application-related attributes.
