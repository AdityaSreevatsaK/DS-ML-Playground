# [National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES)](../c.%20Jupyter%20Notebooks/National%20Health%20and%20Nutrition%20Examination%20Survey%20(NHANES).ipynb)


## Project Overview
The goal of this project is to perform unsupervised learning on a health-related dataset to identify meaningful clusters 
in the data. This analysis aims to uncover inherent patterns and groupings within the dataset based on various health 
features, which could offer insights into how individuals or entities are segmented based on their health-related 
attributes.

## Data Dictionary
- There are 662 features.
- Detailed description available in [Data Dictionary](../b.%20Datasets/NHANES/Data%20Dictionary.xlsx) file.

## Objective
The goal of this project was to perform unsupervised clustering on the health_data dataset to uncover natural groupings 
or patterns without relying on predefined labels. The analysis aimed to identify the most influential features, 
determine optimal clustering parameters, and evaluate the effectiveness of clustering techniques such as KMeans and 
DBSCAN.
