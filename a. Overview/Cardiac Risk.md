# [Cardiac Risk](../c.%20Jupyter%20Notebooks/Cardiac%20Risk.ipynb)


## Project Overview
The dataset contains various health-related features of individuals, including their demographics, lifestyle choices, 
and medical history. The goal of this project is to analyse these features and predict the likelihood of heart disease 
(CVD). This can help in identifying high-risk individuals who might benefit from preventive care and early intervention.

## Data Dictionary
- male: Gender of the individual (1 = male, 0 = female)
- age: Age of the individual in years
- education: Level of education (e.g., 1 = no high school, 2 = high school graduate, etc.)
- currentSmoker: Whether the individual currently smokes (1 = yes, 0 = no)
- cigsPerDay: Number of cigarettes smoked per day
- BPMeds: Whether the individual is on blood pressure medication (1 = yes, 0 = no)
- prevalentStroke: Whether the individual has had a stroke (1 = yes, 0 = no)
- prevalentHyp: Whether the individual has high blood pressure (1 = yes, 0 = no)
- diabetes: Whether the individual has diabetes (1 = yes, 0 = no)
- totChol: Total cholesterol level in mg/dL
- sysBP: Systolic blood pressure (mmHg)
- diaBP: Diastolic blood pressure (mmHg)
- BMI: Body Mass Index (BMI)
- heartRate: Heart rate (beats per minute)
- glucose: Glucose level (mg/dL)
- CVD: Whether the individual has cardiovascular disease (1 = yes, 0 = no)

## Objective
The primary objective of this project is to predict the presence or absence of cardiovascular disease (CVD) in 
individuals based on various health, lifestyle, and demographic features. By building a predictive model, the goal is to 
identify individuals at high risk for CVD, which can aid in preventative measures and healthcare management.
