# [Possum Morphometric Analysis](../c.%20Jupyter%20Notebooks/Possum%20Morphometric%20Analysis.ipynb)


## Project Overview:
This project explores the morphometric measurements of mountain brushtail possums to develop regression models that 
predict age, head length, and sex. The dataset provides insights into the relationship between physical characteristics 
and demographic factors.

## Data Dictionary:
- case: Unique identifier for each possum
- site: Location/site where the possum was trapped
- Pop: Population group
- sex: Sex of the possum (male/female)
- age: Estimated age of the possum
- hdlngth: Head length of the possum
- skullw: Skull width of the possum
- totlngth: Total length of the possum
- taill: Tail length of the possum
- footlgth: Foot length of the possum
- earconch: Ear conch size of the possum
- eye: Eye size of the possum
- chest: Chest circumference of the possum
- belly: Belly circumference of the possum

## Objective:
- Predict the age of possums based on morphometric measurements.
- Predict head length of possums as a continuous feature.
- Classify possum sex using the available features.
